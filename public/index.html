            <p id = "p1" >When California went under lockdown, I tried to look on the bright side of the situation. However, little did I know about what this situation would do to my motivation and productivity. After a few months, I struggled with focusing during long periods of time. I found myself procrastinating after doing any task for over an hour. This behavior was not normal for me. I thought the reason was the monotony of the past months. It was tough to be engaged during classes after being in the same room for hours. This situation impacted my performance at the time of working on curricular and extracurricular projects. Thus, I decided to look for ways in which I could be more productive with my time.</p> 
            <p id = "p2" >I ought to highlight that this research started partially without me knowing. I ended up watching countless videos while procrastinating. One of these videos was "The Five Key Principles of Productivity." In this video, Ali Abdaal mentions that capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage are relevant points to consider when keeping a to-do list. Our brains are not designed to memorize all that we have to do in a day in specific detail. Thus, these five points help one to be clear when adding tasks to the to-do list. </p>
            <p id = "p3" >However, These five points emphasized effective organization instead of productivity improvement. Then, I decided to look for knowledge from people who are known for their productivity. In an article on The Entrepreneur, Aaron Agius presented some tips from the most famous business owners. Elon Musk, for instance, avoids distractions like social media, texting, video-chatting, or other forms of real-time communication. He also divides his schedule into blocks of 30 minutes, forcing himself to be mindful about every single minute of his day. Additionally, Mark Zuckerberg makes sure that the goals he and his company pursues are measurable and well-defined. Nevertheless, these practices have become so common that their credibility is at the level of weight-loss pills. I wouldn't say there is an easy, quick fix to increase our performance overnight. A more sophisticated to-do list will most likely not make you more effective at work. </p>
            <p id = "p4" >Motivation is an important area in psychology. One of the most influential scientific works on motivation is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which expresses motivation as a pyramid. Each level determines the person's motivation. The first level is the motivation for food and water; the second level is stability and security; the third level is social connections; the fourth level is self-esteem and esteem from others; the last level is self-actualization. Also, one must fulfill the current level before ascending to a higher level. For instance, if one does not feel secure due to a lack of shelter, one will not be motivated to look for friends or other relationships. </p>
            <p id = "p5" >Maslow's pyramid asks us to be more reflective of ourselves and determine whether we're missing one of the essentials in the pyramid. However, this task is easier said than done. The pyramid scales in difficulty as we go to higher levels. The highest level, self-actualization, can be particularly challenging to fulfill. Satisfying this level might be the reason why people struggle to stay focused. Given that a person has met the lower levels, there will be a strong need to find one's authentic self. The person will experience the desire to learn and explore. Therefore, it is easy to see a performance drop when a person does not value their work. A person without a sense of progress will feel unmotivated and lower their productivity. Other studies have supported this assertion in different ways. </p>
            <p id = "p6" >The psychologists Milyavskaya and Koestner studied motivation through self-determination theory. They found that an individual's motivation ranges from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation. If the individual sees purpose in what they do, motivation will lean towards the intrinsic side of the spectrum. Intrinsic motivation, as its name suggests, comes from the individual. A person with this type of motivation does not expect a reward for doing an activity. Instead, they are motivated because they value what they do. The activity could pose an opportunity to learn, find themselves, or a way to help others. </p>
            <p id = "p7" >I hope that my experience exploring productivity and motivation has helped you in some way. Perhaps it helped regain your focus by making you remember why you do what you do. Maybe it made you reflect on whether there is something you're missing that interferes with your performance. It also could have made you rethink the direction in which you're moving forward. While the organizational techniques recommended at the beginning of this text can be helpful, it is essential that we feel passionate about what we do.</p>
